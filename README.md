Description :
The remove_day_log.sh script is designed to remove log files created on a specific day from Linux servers. It provides a convenient way to clean up log files that are no longer needed, freeing up disk space and improving system performance. The script can be customized to target log files from a specific directory or log files with specific naming patterns.

Features : 
- Removes log files created on a specific day: The script allows you to specify a particular day for log file removal. It finds log files created on that day and deletes them from the system.

- Customizable log file directory: You can modify the script to target log files in a specific directory or a list of directories. By default, it targets the /var/log directory.

- Flexible log file naming patterns: The script can be adapted to match log files with specific naming patterns. For example, it can remove files with names like access_log.20230519 or error_log_2023-05-19.
